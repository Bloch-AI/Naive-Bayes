# Naive Bayes Demo App

# Your Name

#**********************************************
# This Python code creates a web-based application using Streamlit to demonstrate
# the use of Naive Bayes classifiers for sentiment analysis of text reviews.
# Users can enter a restaurant review and select one of three Naive Bayes variants:
# - Multinomial NB
# - Bernoulli NB
# - Gaussian NB
#
# Key steps include:
# 1. Preprocessing the text (tokenisation, lemmatisation and removal of stopwords,
#    including domain-specific ones).
# 2. Training a classifier on a predefined dataset of positive and negative reviews.
# 3. Allowing interactive sentiment analysis.
# 4. Displaying visualisations and a worked numerical calculation to explain the model's decision.
#
# For discrete NB models (Multinomial and Bernoulli), the app calculates token-level
# contributions and sums these with the model's log priors. This sum (the overall log probability
# difference) is used to decide the final sentiment. If the sum is very small (within a user-defined threshold),
# the result is forced to Neutral.
#
# For Gaussian NB, a pie chart of class probabilities is displayed alongside a simple calculation.
#
# An interactive slider lets the user adjust the "Neutrality Threshold" â€“ if the difference
# between the Positive and Negative scores is below this value, the review is shown as Neutral.

    **Naive Bayes Explained Simply:**
    
    Naive Bayes is a classifier that uses probability to decide which category a review belongs to.
    It is based on Bayes' Theorem:
    
    \[
    P(C|X) = \frac{P(X|C) \times P(C)}{P(X)}
    \]
    
    **In plain language:**
    - **\(P(C|X)\)** is the chance the review belongs to a class \(C\) (e.g. Positive) given the words \(X\).
    - **\(P(X|C)\)** tells us how likely it is to see the words \(X\) if the review is of class \(C\).
    - **\(P(C)\)** is how common the class is in the training data (the prior probability).
    - **\(P(X)\)** is a normalising factor.
    
    The classifier starts with a baseline belief (the prior) and updates it with the evidence from the review (the likelihood) to decide the final class.
