# Naive Bayes Demo App

# Your Name
# your.email@example.com
#**********************************************
# This Python code creates a web-based application using Streamlit to demonstrate
# the use of Naive Bayes classifiers for sentiment analysis of text reviews.
# Users can enter a restaurant review and select one of three Naive Bayes variants:
# - Multinomial NB
# - Bernoulli NB
# - Gaussian NB
#
# Key steps include:
# 1. Preprocessing the text (tokenisation, lemmatisation and removal of stopwords, including domain-specific ones).
# 2. Training a classifier on a predefined dataset of positive and negative reviews.
# 3. Allowing interactive sentiment analysis.
# 4. Displaying visualisations and a worked numerical calculation to explain the model's decision.
#
# For discrete NB models (Multinomial and Bernoulli), the app calculates token-level
# contributions and sums these with the model's log priors. For Gaussian NB, a pie chart
# of class probabilities is displayed alongside a simple calculation based on overall probabilities.
#
# An interactive slider allows the user to adjust the "Neutrality Threshold" â€“ if the difference
# between the Positive and Negative scores is very small (below this threshold), the result will be shown as Neutral.

    **Naive Bayes Explained Simply:**
    
    Naive Bayes is a type of classifier that uses probability to decide which category a text belongs to.
    It is based on Bayes' Theorem, which is written as:
    
    \[
    P(C|X) = \frac{P(X|C) \times P(C)}{P(X)}
    \]
    
    - **\(P(C|X)\)**: The probability that the review belongs to class \(C\) (e.g. Positive or Negative) given the words \(X\) in the review.
    - **\(P(X|C)\)**: The likelihood of observing the words \(X\) if the review is of class \(C\).
    - **\(P(C)\)**: The prior probability of class \(C\) â€“ how common the class is in the training data.
    - **\(P(X)\)**: A normalising constant that ensures all probabilities sum to 1.
    
    In simple terms, the classifier starts with a baseline belief about each class (the prior), looks at the words in the review (the likelihood), and updates its belief (the posterior). The class with the highest posterior probability is chosen.
